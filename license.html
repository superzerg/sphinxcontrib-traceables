the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
appear. The contents of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NOTICE</span></code> file are for informational purposes
only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NOTICE</span></code> text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution
notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own
