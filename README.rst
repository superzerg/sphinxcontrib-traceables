A Sphinx extension offering traceability within documentation.

This extension provides functionality to define traceable items and
relationships between them in documentation generated by `Sphinx`_.
It also offers visualization of the traceables in various forms, such
as relationship graphs.

More information is available here:

- Documentation: https://sphinxcontrib-traceables.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
- Download: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-traceables
- Development: https://github.com/t4ngo/sphinxcontrib-traceables

As the original package (https://github.com/t4ngo/sphinxcontrib-traceables) seems to be unmaintained, I updated it so it is compatible with python3 and `Sphinx`_ 3.6.
Thanks to rexut for doing part of the job.
